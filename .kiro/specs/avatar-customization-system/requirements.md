# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The avatar customization system enables family members to personalize their AI assistant's visual appearance, personality traits, and behavioral characteristics. This system provides a safe, engaging way for users to create unique avatar experiences while maintaining child-appropriate content and efficient performance on Jetson Nano Orin hardware.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a family member, I want to customize my avatar's visual appearance, so that my assistant feels personal and reflects my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses avatar customization THEN the system SHALL display options for face, hair, clothing, and accessories
2. WHEN a user selects appearance options THEN the system SHALL render changes in real-time with 60fps performance
3. WHEN customizing appearance THEN the system SHALL provide age-appropriate options based on the user's profile
4. WHEN appearance changes are made THEN the system SHALL save customizations locally with AES-256 encryption
5. IF rendering performance drops below 45fps THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce visual complexity
6. WHEN multiple users exist THEN each SHALL have separate avatar customizations that persist across sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a family member, I want to define my avatar's personality traits, so that interactions feel natural and match my communication style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizing personality THEN the system SHALL offer traits like friendliness, formality, humor level, and enthusiasm
2. WHEN personality traits are selected THEN the system SHALL validate all traits for child-appropriateness
3. WHEN personality is configured THEN the system SHALL integrate with the voice pipeline for consistent responses
4. WHEN personality changes are made THEN the system SHALL update response generation templates immediately
5. IF personality traits conflict with safety rules THEN the system SHALL override with safe defaults and notify parents
6. WHEN interacting with the avatar THEN personality traits SHALL be reflected in both speech patterns and visual expressions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a family member, I want my avatar to have unique voice characteristics, so that the assistant sounds distinctive and personal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizing voice THEN the system SHALL offer options for pitch, speed, accent, and emotional tone
2. WHEN voice characteristics are selected THEN the system SHALL preview changes with sample speech
3. WHEN voice settings are applied THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with the text-to-speech engine
4. WHEN voice characteristics change THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all avatar interactions
5. IF voice processing exceeds performance limits THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce quality while maintaining clarity
6. WHEN multiple family members use the device THEN each SHALL have distinct voice characteristics for their avatar

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a family member, I want my avatar to display appropriate emotions and reactions, so that interactions feel engaging and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the avatar responds to interactions THEN it SHALL display contextually appropriate facial expressions and animations
2. WHEN emotional responses are triggered THEN all expressions SHALL be validated for child-appropriateness
3. WHEN avatar emotions change THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and natural at 60fps
4. WHEN processing user input THEN the avatar SHALL show listening, thinking, and responding states visually
5. IF emotional content is inappropriate THEN the system SHALL default to neutral expressions and log for parental review
6. WHEN avatar personality traits are active THEN emotional expressions SHALL align with the configured personality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a parent, I want to review and approve avatar customizations, so that I can ensure all content is appropriate for my children.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN children make avatar customizations THEN the system SHALL require parental approval for changes
2. WHEN parents review customizations THEN the system SHALL display all proposed changes with safety assessments
3. WHEN inappropriate customizations are detected THEN the system SHALL block them and provide explanations
4. WHEN parents approve changes THEN the system SHALL apply customizations immediately
5. IF parents reject customizations THEN the system SHALL revert to previous settings and explain the decision to the child
6. WHEN customization history is needed THEN parents SHALL have access to all past changes and approval decisions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want avatar customizations to operate efficiently on limited hardware, so that the device remains responsive during visual rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering avatars THEN total GPU memory usage SHALL not exceed 2GB
2. WHEN avatar animations are active THEN CPU usage SHALL not exceed 50% for sustained periods
3. WHEN customizations are being applied THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps rendering performance
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce visual quality rather than drop frames
5. IF memory usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL cache frequently used assets and unload unused ones
6. WHEN multiple avatar operations occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-facing rendering over background processing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a family member, I want my avatar customizations to be preserved and backed up, so that my personalization settings are never lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizations are made THEN the system SHALL automatically save changes locally with encryption
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL restore all user avatar customizations from secure storage
3. WHEN customization data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted with AES-256 and include integrity verification
4. WHEN storage corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL restore from backup and alert parents
5. IF customization loading fails THEN the system SHALL use safe default settings and attempt recovery
6. WHEN users switch profiles THEN avatar customizations SHALL load within 2 seconds
