# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The voice interaction pipeline is the foundational communication system for the home assistant device, enabling natural voice-based interaction between family members and the AI assistant. This system must provide fast, reliable, and child-safe voice processing while operating efficiently on Jetson Nano Orin hardware with offline-first capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a family member, I want to activate the assistant using a wake word, so that I can start a conversation hands-free without touching any buttons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says the wake word THEN the system SHALL activate within 200ms and provide visual feedback
2. WHEN the wake word is detected THEN the system SHALL process audio locally without sending data to external servers
3. WHEN background noise is present THEN the system SHALL distinguish the wake word with 95% accuracy at normal speaking volume
4. WHEN multiple users are present THEN the system SHALL respond to any authorized family member's wake word
5. IF the system is in sleep mode THEN wake word detection SHALL continue to operate with minimal power consumption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a family member, I want the assistant to understand my spoken commands clearly, so that I can communicate naturally without repeating myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user speaks after wake word activation THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text within 500ms
2. WHEN speech recognition is processing THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators to show it's listening
3. WHEN ambient noise exceeds normal levels THEN the system SHALL apply noise reduction before processing speech
4. WHEN a user pauses mid-sentence THEN the system SHALL wait 3 seconds before processing the partial command
5. IF speech recognition confidence is below 80% THEN the system SHALL ask for clarification rather than guess
6. WHEN processing speech THEN the system SHALL support multiple languages configured per user profile

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a family member, I want the assistant to respond with natural-sounding speech, so that conversations feel comfortable and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates a response THEN it SHALL convert text to speech within 300ms
2. WHEN speaking responses THEN the system SHALL use age-appropriate language and tone for the current user
3. WHEN multiple response options exist THEN the system SHALL vary speech patterns to avoid repetitive responses
4. WHEN the user interrupts during speech THEN the system SHALL stop speaking immediately and listen for new input
5. IF text-to-speech processing fails THEN the system SHALL display the response visually as fallback
6. WHEN generating speech THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent voice characteristics per avatar personality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a parent, I want all voice interactions to be safe and appropriate for children, so that I can trust the assistant around my family.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any voice command THEN the system SHALL validate content safety before executing actions
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL filter all content through child-safety validation
3. WHEN inappropriate content is detected THEN the system SHALL block the interaction and log the attempt for parental review
4. WHEN a child user is detected THEN the system SHALL apply stricter content filtering rules
5. IF safety validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide a generic safe response rather than expose filtered content
6. WHEN voice data is processed THEN the system SHALL never store raw audio recordings permanently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice commands to be routed to the appropriate system functions, so that the assistant can help with various household tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a voice command is recognized THEN the system SHALL identify the intended function within 100ms
2. WHEN command intent is unclear THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions rather than make assumptions
3. WHEN a command requires device control THEN the system SHALL route to the smart home integration module
4. WHEN a command involves scheduling THEN the system SHALL route to the calendar and reminder system
5. IF a command cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL explain what went wrong in user-friendly terms
6. WHEN routing commands THEN the system SHALL maintain context from previous interactions in the conversation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the voice pipeline to operate efficiently on limited hardware, so that the device remains responsive and doesn't consume excessive resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the voice pipeline is active THEN total memory usage SHALL not exceed 2GB of the available 8GB RAM
2. WHEN processing voice commands THEN CPU usage SHALL not exceed 70% for more than 5 seconds
3. WHEN the system is idle THEN voice processing SHALL consume less than 100MB RAM for wake word detection
4. WHEN multiple voice operations occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue and prioritize requests appropriately
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce processing quality rather than fail
6. WHEN voice processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL recover automatically within 2 seconds

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a family member, I want the voice system to work even when internet is unavailable, so that basic assistant functions remain accessible during outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN internet connectivity is lost THEN core voice processing SHALL continue to operate normally
2. WHEN operating offline THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which features are unavailable
3. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically resume full functionality
4. WHEN offline THEN voice commands for local device control SHALL continue to work
5. IF cloud-dependent features are requested offline THEN the system SHALL explain the limitation and offer alternatives
6. WHEN operating in offline mode THEN response times SHALL remain under the 500ms requirement
