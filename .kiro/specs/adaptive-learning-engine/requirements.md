# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Adaptive Learning Engine is the central intelligence system that powers the Home Assistant's ability to learn from user interactions and become increasingly personalized over time. This system integrates an internal LLM for decision making across all user activities including conversations, scheduling, recommendations, and smart home interactions. The engine continuously analyzes user patterns, preferences, and behaviors to fine-tune responses and proactively assist users in a child-safe, privacy-focused manner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a family member, I want the assistant to learn my preferences and habits over time, so that it can provide increasingly personalized and helpful responses without me having to repeatedly explain my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the assistant THEN the system SHALL capture interaction patterns while maintaining privacy standards
2. WHEN the system processes user data THEN it SHALL apply child safety filters and content validation before any learning occurs
3. WHEN learning from interactions THEN the system SHALL store only anonymized behavioral patterns, not raw conversation content
4. WHEN personalizing responses THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the user's established preferences and communication style

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a parent, I want the learning system to respect parental controls and safety boundaries, so that my children receive age-appropriate interactions even as the system learns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing child user interactions THEN the system SHALL enforce stricter learning boundaries and content filters
2. WHEN a child's profile is active THEN the system SHALL require parental approval for any significant behavioral adaptations
3. WHEN learning from family interactions THEN the system SHALL maintain separate learning contexts for different family members
4. WHEN applying learned behaviors THEN the system SHALL never override established safety rules or parental controls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the assistant to make intelligent decisions about scheduling, reminders, and recommendations based on my past behavior, so that it can proactively help me manage my daily activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing user scheduling patterns THEN the system SHALL identify optimal times for different types of activities
2. WHEN making scheduling suggestions THEN the system SHALL consider learned preferences, conflicts, and user availability patterns
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL use learned user interests while maintaining content safety standards
4. WHEN making proactive suggestions THEN the system SHALL respect user privacy settings and opt-out preferences

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the learning engine to operate efficiently within Jetson Nano Orin constraints, so that learning doesn't impact real-time performance or system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing learning algorithms THEN the system SHALL maintain memory usage under 2GB for learning operations
2. WHEN updating user models THEN the system SHALL complete updates within 100ms to avoid impacting real-time interactions
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN learning processes SHALL be throttled or paused to prioritize user interactions
4. WHEN storage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or compress older learning data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want control over what the system learns about me and the ability to reset or modify learned behaviors, so that I maintain agency over my personal data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to view learned data THEN the system SHALL provide a clear summary of behavioral patterns and preferences
2. WHEN a user wants to modify learned behaviors THEN the system SHALL allow selective deletion or adjustment of specific learned patterns
3. WHEN a user requests data reset THEN the system SHALL completely clear learned behaviors while maintaining safety configurations
4. WHEN learning is disabled THEN the system SHALL continue to function with default behaviors without degraded performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the learning engine to integrate seamlessly with existing avatar, voice, and smart home systems, so that learned behaviors enhance all aspects of the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN avatar interactions occur THEN the learning engine SHALL adapt avatar personality and responses based on user preferences
2. WHEN voice interactions happen THEN the system SHALL learn speech patterns and preferred communication styles
3. WHEN smart home devices are controlled THEN the system SHALL learn usage patterns and automate routine actions
4. WHEN integrating with other systems THEN the learning engine SHALL provide standardized APIs for behavioral insights

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to learn from context and environmental factors, so that it can make more intelligent decisions based on time, location, and situational awareness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environmental context changes THEN the system SHALL adapt learned behaviors to current conditions
2. WHEN time-based patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL proactively suggest actions based on historical timing preferences
3. WHEN routine disruptions occur THEN the system SHALL adapt suggestions while learning new patterns
4. WHEN multiple users are present THEN the system SHALL balance learned preferences across active family members
