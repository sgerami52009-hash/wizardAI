# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The personalized recommendations engine provides intelligent, contextual suggestions to family members based on their preferences, behavior patterns, schedule, and current context. This system learns from user interactions to deliver helpful recommendations for activities, scheduling optimizations, content, and household management while maintaining strict child safety controls and efficient operation on Jetson Nano Orin hardware.

6. WHEN making educational recommendations THEN parents SHALL have oversight and approval rights for all suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a family member, I want contextual recommendations based on my current situation, so that suggestions are relevant and timely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user context changes THEN the system SHALL adapt recommendations to current location, activity, and availability
2. WHEN environmental factors change THEN the system SHALL update recommendations based on weather, time of day, and season
3. WHEN family dynamics change THEN the system SHALL adjust suggestions based on who is present and their combined preferences
4. WHEN user mood or energy levels are detected THEN the system SHALL tailor recommendations to match current state
5. IF context is unclear THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions rather than make inappropriate suggestions
6. WHEN delivering contextual recommendations THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning behind suggestions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a family member, I want recommendations that help improve household efficiency, so that daily routines run more smoothly.

6. WHEN making efficiency recommendations THEN the system SHALL prioritize suggestions that reduce stress and save time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a family member, I want privacy-respecting recommendations, so that my personal information is protected while still receiving helpful suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
